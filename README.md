Running the App Locally
Backend:

In the backend directory:

npm start
This will start your Express server (by default on http://localhost:3001 or whichever port is configured).
Frontend:

In the frontend/blog-frontend directory:
bash

npm run dev
This will launch the React application (by default on http://localhost:5173, or whatever port Vite uses).
Open the application:

Visit your frontend dev server address (e.g., http://localhost:5173) in your web browser.
The frontend should be configured to make requests to the backend endpoint.
(Adjust port numbers if yours differ.)

Deployment
Backend: Deployed on Render.

Make sure your environment variables (like database credentials) are configured on Render.
Endpoints: e.g. https://warhammer-blog-backend.onrender.com
Frontend:

If you deploy the frontend on Render or another platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel), ensure your .env or config.js points the API calls to the correct Render backend URL.
